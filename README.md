## **Stoicism**

**Stoicism** will teach us how to keep our **composure** in times of difficulties. We don't need to react negatively to failures, but rather work with them for our improvement in the future.

Realistically, problems are **unadvoidable**, thus we should react normally to them and find a solution instead.
